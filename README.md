This is repo of CSCE 625 assignment 2 assembly puzzle
see asgn2.pdf for the problem

To run the code, using the ipython notebook to open the file "assembly_puzzle.ipynb"

If you don't use ipython notebook, for your convinence I generate a python file "assembly_puzzle.py", you can run this to see the result. But the complete codes are in ipynb file.


You are welcome to use this code as part of your solution. Please contact me if you have better solution and I'm willing to talk.

.idea/ is pycharm project directory, you can use pycharm to open this directory.
